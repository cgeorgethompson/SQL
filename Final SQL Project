###In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer, employee, and order data.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT CustomerId
, FirstName
, LastName
, Country
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != 'USA';

#2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
SELECT cust.FirstName
, cust.LastName
, inv.InvoiceID
, inv.InvoiceDate
, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil'
ORDER BY InvoiceDate asc;

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT EmployeeId
, LastName
, FirstName
, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
SELECT inv.InvoiceId
, emp.EmployeeId
, emp.LastName
, emp.FirstName
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees as emp
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
ORDER BY emp.EmployeeId ASC;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.InvoiceId
, inv.Total
, cust.Firstname
, cust.LastName
, cust.Country
, emp.FirstName||' '||emp.LastName as EmployeeName
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees as emp
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
ORDER BY cust.LastName ASC;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01; AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),3)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.Name, items.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items as items
JOIN chinook.Tracks as tracks
ON items.TrackId  = tracks.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT art.Name as ArtistName
, tracks.Name as TrackName
, items.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items as items
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks as tracks
ON items.TrackId  = tracks.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums as alb
ON tracks.AlbumId = alb.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists as art
ON alb.ArtistId = art.ArtistId
ORDER BY ArtistName;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT track.Name as TrackName
, alb.Title as AlbumTitle
, media.Name as MediaType
, gen.Name as Genre
FROM chinook.tracks as track
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums as alb
ON track.albumid = alb.albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.media_types as media
ON track.mediatypeid = media.mediatypeid
LEFT JOIN chinook.genres as gen
ON track.genreid = gen.genreid;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),3) as TotalSales
,emp.FirstName||' '||emp.LastName as SalesAgent
FROM chinook.invoices as inv

JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid

JOIN chinook.employees as emp
ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY SalesAgent;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),3) as TotalSales
,emp.FirstName||' '||emp.LastName as SalesAgent
, substr(inv.InvoiceDate, 1, instr(inv.InvoiceDate, '-') - 1) AS InvoiceYear
FROM chinook.invoices as inv

JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid

JOIN chinook.employees as emp
ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND InvoiceYear = '2009'
GROUP BY SalesAgent
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC LIMIT 1;
